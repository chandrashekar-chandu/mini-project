# CodeArena - Competitive Programming Platform

## Introduction

In today's competitive programming landscape, providing an accessible platform for skill development and assessment is increasingly vital for educational institutions and tech communities. CodeArena – Competitive Programming Platform is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to facilitate coding challenges, contests, and skill evaluation through automation, gamification, and real-time leaderboards.

CodeArena supports three primary user roles—Administrator, Contestant, and Participant—to operate seamlessly within a unified environment. The platform enables administrators to create and manage coding challenges and contests, contestants to solve problems and compete in time-bound events, and participants to practice coding skills with instant feedback. Real-time leaderboards, dynamic rating systems, and achievement badges ensure engagement and motivation across all interactions.

The system is developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for full-stack integration, with Tailwind CSS and Monaco Editor enhancing the user experience through modern, responsive interfaces and advanced code editing capabilities. Authentication is secured using JWT (JSON Web Token) and bcrypt.js, while Judge0 API facilitates automated code execution and testing across multiple programming languages.

CodeArena eliminates manual evaluation processes, improves coding accessibility, and enhances skill development through gamification. By integrating automated testing, modular design, and real-time performance tracking, the system significantly reduces administrative overhead and fosters a competitive yet collaborative coding ecosystem. This project demonstrates how modern web technologies can effectively transform traditional coding education into a scalable, interactive, and intelligent learning solution.
