## 🔐 Access Control

**Protected Routes (Admin-Only):**
- `/admin` - Admin Panel
- `/admin/create-contest` - Create Contest Page
- `/admin/edit-contest/:contestId` - Edit Contest Page
- `/admin/create-problem` - Create Problem Page
- `/admin/edit-problem/:problemId` - Edit Problem Page

**Security Checks:**

## 📊 State Management

### AdminPanel Component States:
```javascript
const [contests, setContests] = useState([]);        // List of contests
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);       // Global loading state
const [deletingId, setDeletingId] = useState(null);  // Current deleting contest ID
```

### State Updates:
- On delete success: `contests` array filtered to remove deleted item
- `deletingId` tracks which contest is being deleted (for UI feedback)
- `loading` prevents multiple simultaneous operations

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Frontend:**
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useNavigate)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation

**Backend API Endpoints:**
- `DELETE /api/contests/{contestId}` - Delete contest
- `GET /api/contests` - Fetch all contests
- `PUT /api/contests/{contestId}` - Update contest
- `POST /api/contests` - Create contest
