## 💾 Files Modified

### `frontend/src/pages/AdminPanel.js`

**Key Changes:**
1. Added `handleDeleteContest()` function
2. Added `loading` and `deletingId` state variables
3. Added `contestStats` calculation using `reduce()`
4. Added 3 new stat cards (Active, Upcoming, Past)
5. Updated Delete button to be functional
6. Added confirmation dialogs

**Statistics Logic:**
```javascript
// Automatically count contests by status
const contestStats = contests.reduce(
  (stats, contest) => {
    const status = getContestStatus(contest);
    if (status === 'upcoming') stats.upcoming++;
    else if (status === 'ongoing') stats.active++;
    else stats.past++;
    return stats;
  },
  { upcoming: 0, active: 0, past: 0 }
);
```

**Delete Logic:**
```javascript
// Safely delete with confirmation
const handleDeleteContest = async (contestId, contestTitle) => {
  if (!window.confirm(`Delete "${contestTitle}"?`)) return;
  
  setDeletingId(contestId);
  try {
    await axios.delete(`/api/contests/${contestId}`);
    setContests(contests.filter(c => c._id !== contestId));
    alert('Deleted successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    alert('Delete failed: ' + error.message);
  }
};
```
