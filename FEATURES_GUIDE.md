3. Check constraints (time, memory limits)
4. Test with example test cases
5. Edge cases are important!
6. Use Run Code for debugging

### For Contests
1. Read all problems before starting
2. Solve easier problems first (more time for harder ones)
3. Manage time wisely
4. Submit even partial solutions for points
5. Check leaderboard regularly

### For Admins

## üìä Code Execution Details

### Judge0 Integration
- Uses RapidAPI for code execution
- Supports 20+ languages
- Timeout: 10 seconds per test case
- Memory limit: Varies by language

### When Judge0 API Key Not Provided
- Platform uses simulation mode
- Basic code structure validation
- Simulated execution results
- Suitable for development/testing
- Production should use real Judge0 API

### Error Types
- **Accepted**: All test cases passed ‚úÖ
- **Wrong Answer**: Output doesn't match expected ‚ùå
- **Runtime Error**: Code crashes during execution üí•
- **Time Limit Exceeded**: Code takes too long ‚è±Ô∏è
- **Compilation Error**: Syntax or compilation issue üî¥

## üîê Security Features

### Authentication
- JWT token-based auth
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token stored in localStorage
- Auto-logout after browser close

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (User/Admin)
- Only admins can create contests/challenges
- Users can only see their own submissions
- Hidden test cases only used for grading

### Data Protection
- MongoDB connection via Atlas (encrypted)
- CORS enabled for development
- Secure HTTP headers (in production)
- Input validation on all endpoints

## üöÄ Performance Notes

### Optimization Tips
1. **Pagination**: All lists support pagination
2. **Lean Queries**: Database queries optimized
3. **Caching**: Leaderboard can be cached
4. **Indexing**: Database indexes on frequently queried fields

### Large Scale Considerations
- Add Redis for caching
- Use CDN for static assets
- Load balancing for multiple instances
- Database sharding for large datasets
