   This action cannot be undone."
   ```
5. Click **"Cancel"** (or press Escape)

- Can still edit contests while delete feature available

---

### Test 7: Button States

**Steps:**
1. Click "Delete" on a contest (don't confirm)
2. Click "Delete" on another contest
3. Check button appearance

**Expected Result:** ✅
- First delete button: Normal state (because dialog cancelled)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Delete button not responding:
```
❌ Problem: Click doesn't work
✅ Solution:
   1. Check browser console (F12 → Console)
   2. Look for JavaScript errors
   3. Verify admin authentication token in localStorage
   4. Try logging out and back in
```

### Confirmation dialog doesn't appear:
```
❌ Problem: Click Delete, nothing happens
✅ Solution:
   1. Check if browser has popups disabled
   2. Try in incognito/private mode
   3. Check browser console for errors
```

### Delete shows error but contest still deletes:
```
❌ Problem: Error message, but contest disappears
✅ Solution:
   1. This is a UI/backend sync issue
   2. Refresh page to verify actual state
   3. Check backend logs for errors
```

### Contest doesn't disappear after delete:
```
❌ Problem: Success message, but contest still in table
✅ Solution:
   1. Refresh the page (F5)
   2. Check if delete actually succeeded in backend
   3. Look for JavaScript errors in console
   4. Verify correct contest was deleted
```

### Permission denied error:
```
❌ Problem: Delete fails with "Access Denied"
✅ Solution:
   1. Verify account has admin role
   2. Log out and log back in
   3. Check token is valid in localStorage
   4. Ensure Authorization header is sent
```
